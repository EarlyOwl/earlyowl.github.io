# About this project

## What is it?
The purpose of this project is simply sharing useful guides, tools, workarounds and many more with you other fellow SysAdmins out there.

If you want to contribute or report an issue, feel free to do so by opening a GitHub issue or by sending an email at **sosysadmin** ***[at]*** **proton.me**

## How does it work?
The website itself is served through ***GitHub pages***, you can learn more about it [here](https://pages.github.com/). It resides on my personal repository, [EarlyOwl/earlyowl.github.io](https://github.com/EarlyOwl/earlyowl.github.io) and it's reachable at:
- [earlyowl.github.io](https://earlyowl.github.io/) (my username)
- [sosyadmin.com](http://sosysadmin.com/) (the project name, custom domain)


The documentation is all written in [**GitHub markdown format**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) and then converted into a "standard" (***HTML***) website thanks to **Retype**. You can check it out on the official repo [retypeapp/retype](https://github.com/retypeapp/retype).

## But, where are the .md files?
The ***.md*** files used to generate the webpages you see are kept in a private repo I use for version control. In this repo I only push the "finished product" generated by **Retype**, which basically is the output of the command:
```bash
retype build config_filename.yml
```
